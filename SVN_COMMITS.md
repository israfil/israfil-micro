# SVN Commits

The original project was on israfil-micro.googlecode.com, which was shut down in 2015/2016. The original commit history
of the subversion repo isn't available, but the commit list is, and is represented here. 

The first draft of this code actually was written in 2007, but was first published into an external repository in 2008
in order to open-source it.
